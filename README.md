### Overview
While our analysis was good, we need to get more tempature trends before opening up the surf shop. W.Avy, specifically asks for us to find out temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. From here, we can decide if the surf/ice cream shop business is able to run all year long. 

### Results

* The first result that we come to is that the average temperatures are almost the same. June holds a average temperature of 74 degrees while December holds an average temperature of 71 degrees.
* The second result that we come to is the max temperature for the two months are alike as well. June holds a Max Temperature of 85 degrees while December holds a max temperature of 83 degrees.
* The third result we come to is the difference between the min of the two months. The min temperature for June is 64 degrees while the min temperature for December is 56 degrees.

### Summary
Overall, what we can take from our analysis is that this could be a year round business. While there are days that are colder than others comparing June to December, there wasn't too much of a difference in temperature. Two additional queries that I would add to gather more weather data are: 
* First, to find out when the lowest temperatures take place. This is important, especially in December. We want to make sure that the coldest days are near the end of the month, this could help us in organizing Holiday events/ hours. 
* Second, potentially adding other months instead of just limiting to June and December. While both months could be crucial for business decisions, looking at all the months would help with the decision.
