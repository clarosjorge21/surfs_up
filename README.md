# surfs_up

### Overview
While our analysis was good, we need to get more tempature trends before opening up the surf shop. W.Avy, specifically asks for us to find out temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. From here, we can decide if the surf/ice cream shop business is able to run all year long.
